      <section><h2>Review of a concert</h2>
        At first sight – those who have seen We Have Band music videos and anticipated
        explosion of colours on the stage were surprised by the hanging mosquito net
        and just four spotlights reminding of honeycomb. At first “ear” – ‘Divisive’
        and 3 tones were enough, tones of voices: Thomas, Dede and Darren. Along with guitar,
        sampler and drum kit they turned Dream Of A Bee (venue) into a spinning discoball
        with people dancing frantically like moths around a light bulb. Tempo and energy
        were increasing with every song (from the debut album ‘WHB’) till ‘You Came Out’
        when they reached their zenith. The crowd, not even on dope, jumped up and down
        while whistling the chorus completely out of tune. Then during ‘Oh’ the public
        outshouted the band still bouncing on their feet like they would have little
        springs in soles of their shoes. We Have Band took a bow and left the stage
        but Polish audience just started to enjoy themselves. Called out by chanting
        coming from dozens of throats red from screaming echoing around the basement
        the trio played three encores and when everyone thought that ‘Honey Trap’ is
        the icing on the cake, the band served ‘Oh’ once more. Oh, what a great concert
        it was!

        “We look forward to your hot, rude, full of ignorance and erudition texts” –
        this is how online portal elephantshoe.pl tried to encourage people to join
        their team. And this also reflects how their website looks like – reviews
        of the freshest albums and singles from the shelf labelled ‘alternative/independent
        music’ are preceded by editorials rich in juicy ‘fcuk’ and totally un-pc
        jokes about the downfall of the politics. For their first birthday they invited
        Gra Pozorów (Crying Game) and Coldair who adorned the covers of the two early
        issues of the magazine Elephant Shoe (yes, this is the moment when you go to the
        website and check out those pics). GP describes themselves on myspace (no,
        this isn’t the moment when you go to myspace and check it out) as ‘black metal’
        but they’re neither very black nor metal... Although Cool Kids of Death wouldn’t
        abnegate them and MTV Rocks could embrace them between the playlists (if only
        they played Polish music of course). Coldair is a project of Tobiasz Biliński.
        Another project? – asked someone from the back of the room. Another one and I
        dare to say the best one. He no longer bows his head before Akron/Family and
        Animal Collective like he did in Kyst, but nods in the direction of Sam Amidon
        and Sufjan Stevens which turned out into ’merican” folk. And the supporting
        act will be performed by a band called Dog Whistle – two girls, no website...
        So you need to come and see these peculiarities (was supposed to be ‘personalities’,
        sorry): rockmen without leather jackets and long hair; a guy who likes to be
        photographed with a cat instead of a T-shirt; and last humans on earth without
        WWW address.

        Casu marzu is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese, notable for containing
        live insect larvae, which are a crucial part of the dish. Derived from Pecorino,
        casu marzu goes beyond typical fermentation to a stage most would consider
        decomposition, brought about by the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese
        fly Piophila casei. The larvae themselves appear as translucent white worms,
        about 8 millimetres (0.3 in) long. Casu marzu is considered to be unsafe to be
        eaten when the maggots in the cheese have died. Because of this, only cheese
        in which the maggots are still alive is usually eaten. Since the larvae
        in the cheese can launch themselves for distances up to 15 centimetres (6 in)
        when disturbed, diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the maggots
        from leaping. Those who do not wish to eat live maggots place the cheese in
        a sealed paper bag. The maggots, starved for oxygen, writhe and jump in the bag,
        creating a "pitter-patter" sound. When the sounds subside, the maggots are dead
        and the cheese can be eaten. Casu marzu is believed to be an aphrodisiac by
        Sardinians… Casu marzu is also a title of a song by Simian Mobile Disco from
        their newest album ‘Delicacies’. Every music piece on this CD is named after
        an exotic and bizarre dainty from around the globe. Flies are attracted...
        Who’s seen the video to ‘Sweetbread’ knows what to eat it with! Check the
        ‘Delicacies’ worth 5 Michelin Stars on 18th December in 1500sqm. Served
        by James Ford and James Shaw.
